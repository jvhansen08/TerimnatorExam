# Notes from Walkthrough September 6 2023

Question 2:

- 80% of firetruck effort on question 2 to make the turn

  Question 3: (Should be able to get both parts)

- Calibrate the thing
- Take a video recording of a moving object and plot the probations. Describe the error and the issues there
- Will talk about in class

Question 4:

- A is a gimme point
- B solves chicken and egg problem. Tricker than question 3 algorithms to implement. Show the map and discuss it
- C Lookup the cost of all the sensors.
- D (Grad students) Orb slam algorithm outside. (Will discuss ROS in class Robot Operating System). Talk about specifically which landmarks you could see and what the distances were.

Question 5

- A Diagram contrasting reinforcement learning and controls
- B Cart pole problem. Teach it how to do it. Once it can work, make the right .5% more and show the video of what it looks like

Question 6:

- FER library. Gimme points (just watch video and implement)

Question 7:

- Don’t need to implement the algorithms, just use them. Compare and contrast them

Question 8:

- Classify images using whatever we want (Ex. ResNet, GoogleNet)
- Deploy YOLO on the raspberry Pi
- D shouldn’t be too much of an additional burden

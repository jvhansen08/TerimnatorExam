## Tips From September 22 2023

- Use binocular Orb Slam 3
- Hardest part was compiling the code.
- Use Ros for this

Install dependencies:

- Opencv
- Eigen3
- Pangolin
- DBoW3
- g2o
- ROS

Edit cMake files to point towards the newest version (some point towards 3 other towards 4)

Once installed, do camera calibration. (Easier to use the camera already calibrated.)

Start the nodes

```bash
roscore
```

Plug into USB-3 port.

Create bag_files. Record the room on laptop (run this and walk around the room)

```bash
rosbag record /camera/image_raw
```

CTRL+C to stop recording.

```bash
rosrun ORB_SLAM3 Mono Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/RealSense.yaml
```

Play that recording:

```bash
rosbag play
```

Take a picture of the final map and the saved recording to turn in.

# TerimnatorExam

## For the Graders

We have organized this repo to contain answers to each question. Each question has its own folder, and each folder contains a QX.md file with the answer to the question, as well as any other files that may be necessary to answer the question. For example, in the folder Q1 there is a q1.md file, where the explanations are.

To simplify the installation process, we put the requirements.md file in the root of this repository. Install the requirements into a virtual envrionment. The instructions for this are below.

Because there can be so many issues with various installations, we have also included videos of programs running. If available, these will be found in the corresponding folder for the question.

## Setup

Create the virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment

MacOS

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the requirementsls

```bash
pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

Deactivate the virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```

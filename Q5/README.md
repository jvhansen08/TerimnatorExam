# Instructions

Be sure to use the installation [instructions](../README.md) found in the root of this repository to install the necessary dependencies. Once they are installed in a virtual env, you can run the simulation.

To run the simulation, execute this command from the within the `Q5` directory:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will play through the cartpole simulation using the ml model, and then the frozenlake model.

The questions are answered in the [Q5.md](./Q5.md) file.

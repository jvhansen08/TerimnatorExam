# The Cart Problem

The equations of motion that govern the inverted pendulum system describe the relationship between the various forces and torques acting on the cart and the pendulum. To analyze and control the system, you typically use Newton's second law for translational and rotational motion.

1. **Translational Motion of the Cart**:

   The translational motion of the cart along the horizontal axis (typically the x-axis) is governed by Newton's second law, which relates the force applied to the cart to its acceleration:

   $F = M \cdot \ddot{x}$

   - $F$ is the net force applied to the cart.
   - $M$ is the mass of the cart.
   - $\ddot{x}$ is the acceleration of the cart along the x-axis.

2. **Rotational Motion of the Pendulum**:

   The rotational motion of the pendulum is described by the following equations:

   a. Torque Equilibrium Equation:

   $I \cdot \ddot{\theta} = \tau$

   - $I$ is the moment of inertia of the pendulum about its pivot point.
   - $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration of the pendulum.
   - $\tau$ is the total torque acting on the pendulum.

   b. Torque Due to Gravity:

   $\tau_{\text{gravity}} = -m \cdot g \cdot L \cdot \sin(\theta)$

   - $m$ is the mass of the pendulum.
   - $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
   - $L$ is the length of the pendulum.
   - $\theta$ is the angle between the pendulum and the vertical axis.

   c. Control Torque:

   $\tau_{\text{control}} = u$

   - $u$ is the control torque applied to the pendulum by the actuator or control system.

3. **System Interactions**:

   - The control input $u$ (the torque applied to the pendulum) directly affects the angular acceleration $\ddot{\theta}$ of the pendulum.

   - The angle $\theta$ of the pendulum affects the gravitational torque $\tau_{\text{gravity}}$, which opposes the motion. If the pendulum deviates from the upright position, this torque tries to pull it back towards equilibrium.

   - The cart's position $x$ affects the center of mass of the pendulum. A change in $x$ can affect the location at which the gravitational torque is applied to the pendulum.

To control the system and maintain the balance of the inverted pendulum, we must design a control law that computes the control torque $u$ applied to the pendulum based on measurements of the pendulum's angle $\theta$, angular velocity $\dot{\theta}$, and the cart's position $x$ and velocity $\dot{x}$. The goal is to keep $\theta$ close to zero and stabilize the system.

The specific control algorithm used (e.g., PID control, LQR control, MPC) will determine how these equations are integrated and how feedback is used to adjust the control input to maintain balance. The choice of control strategy and the design of the control gains are critical to the system's stability and performance.

# Part B

We solved the cart-pole problem in 2 ways: 1 was using a PID controller and finding a ratio of 1, 0, 4 for the P, I, and D values respectively. This allowed the cart to move slowly along the axis and stay upright.

The other way we created a neural network and trained the cart to stay upright. They are both effective in staying upright, however the PID controller tends to move slower than the neural network trained cart. This averages 209.6 steps per episode.

# Part C

The maximum recoverable angle is given by the equation $\theta_{max} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \theta_{eq}$, where $\theta_{eq}$ is the angle at which the pendulum is in equilibrium. This is because the pendulum is in equilibrium when the gravitational torque is equal to the control torque, and the gravitational torque is proportional to $\sin(\theta)$, so the maximum angle is when $\sin(\theta) = 1$. The maximum angle is also proportional to the length of the pendulum, so a longer pendulum can be at a larger angle and still be recoverable. The maximum recoverable angle for this pendulum .8 meters long is: $\theta_{max} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \arctan(\frac{.8}{.2}) = 1.3258$ radians, or 75.9 degrees.

Experimentally, the highest recoverable value was 79.91 degrees. This is likely due to the difference between the analytical equations and running the actual model.

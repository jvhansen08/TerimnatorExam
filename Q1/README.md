# Instructions

Be sure to use the installation [instructions](../README.md) found in the root of this repository.

To run the simulation, execute this command from the within the `Q1` directory:

```bash
python3 demo.py
```

This will play through the simulation using the ml model, the controller, and the default non-trained model to show the difference between the three.

If you would like to execute the trained model, execute, comment out the first lines of the demo and run the demo again.

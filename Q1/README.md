# Instructions

Be sure to use the installation [instructions](../README.md) found in the root of this repository.

To run the simulation, execute this command from the root of the repository:

```bash
python3 Q1/demo.py
```

This will first play a demo to see what it is like without any guidance, then go through the PID controller and the ML model response.
